MainPage.html is serving as the landing page of the website with mainpage.css being the design page
  we will have seperate css pages for each of the pages in the website

Edited the screen size problem. I think I figured it out. I did the code on my tv, and now will load it on my laptop to see if everything is still showing up right.
